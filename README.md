## Add Maven repository
Until this package is deployed to maven central this can be accessed from our private maven repository
```
repositories {
    maven(url = "https://premex.jfrog.io/artifactory/premex/")
}
```

## Download
```
dependencies {
    implementation("com.github.warting:permissionsui:<latest_version>")
}
```

## How to use
All you need to do is to call `LocationInBackgroundTutorialView`:
```
LocationInBackgroundTutorialView()
```


Example:
```
import se.warting.permissionsui.backgroundlocation.LocationInBackgroundTutorialView

class MainActivity : ComponentActivity() {
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContent {
            BackgroundLocationPermissionRationaleTheme {
                Surface(color = MaterialTheme.colors.background) {
                    LocationInBackgroundTutorialView()
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
